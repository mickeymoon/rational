This project is a rational number expression solver which takes input as a rational expression provided as a String and 
solves the result by providing the output as rational number expressed in the form of p/q where p and q are integers
and q>0.

For example for a given expression in string format: "1/3+3/5*(1/3+2/9)^2" the project parses the expression and solves 
it to yield the result as "14/27" by applying the general rules of BODMAS and parenthesis.
